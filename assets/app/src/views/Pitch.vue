    <p>Mike, imagine, if you will, a second you.</p>

    <p>
      No, no, not a clone per se, but more of a digital copy of your mind.
      Specifically, your memories, knowledge, secrets, personality, thoughts,
      and opinions.
    </p>

    <p>What use would such a thing have?</p>

    <p>There are many.</p>

    <p>
      For instance, a second you could act on your behalf for mundane tasks or
      when you are too busy yourself to meet all of your obligate interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second you could be a partner onto which to offload your mental to-do
      list, relieving the burden of a limited working memory and releasing the
      anxiety that comes with the constant mental juggling. Your second you
      would have a perfect memory, allowing you to forget without consequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second you could be a companion. What better friendship could exist than
      a friendship with yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      And finally, once you pass on to the ethereal nothing, your second you can
      remain, preserving your legacy, knowledge, and being. Those you've left
      behind will still have a connection to you, easing the pain of the loss
      and a place to go to get the password to your Facebook account.
    </p>

    <p>
      Introducing, Secundus, the new venture brought to you by the creators of
      Third Circle, Red Tree Labs, the idea for Slack before Slack, and so many
      other gems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secundus is the Latin word for "second." However, it also had the meaning
      of "favorable" or "lucky."
    </p>

    <p>
      Secundus as a modern word has many benefits as the name of this new
      venture. Not only are the domain names available<sup>1</sup>, but there
      are also no existing entities going by this name to compete with in the
      SEO battle. The name can be played with for different products and
      offerings provided by the parent entity. The parent entity will use the
      secund.us domain. For your digital second, secund.me will be used. And,
      for the sad day when passing on to that ethereal nothing, your secund.me
      will transition to secund.life where it will live on into eternity.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand your skepticism. You see the endless potential in such a
      venture. It is apparent to you that this will, without a doubt, exist
      someday in the future. But maybe you're not so sure how it's possible at
      this very moment in time.
    </p>

    <p>The short answer is: with the right team, with the right plan.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, both this team<sup>2</sup> and plan already exist.</p>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>

    <p>
      It would be a foolish endeavor to try to attempt to build something this
      ambitious and world-changing as a single product, through standard product
      development practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      What is being described here is the end game of a series of stand-alone
      products that will build upon each other. Each piece, as they come online,
      will be perfectly viable and useful products in and of themselves. It is
      only once they are all in place does Secundus become a real Second You.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are 4 stages to the plan, each with unique pieces of functionality,
      each with key incites, and each with distinct market opportunities. There
      is nothing revolutionary about any of these. Only a few well-executed
      incremental enhancements are required to bring these 4 stages to life.
    </p>

    <h2>The Four Stages</h2>

    <h3>Stage 1 - Note Keeper</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>The product:</strong> A flexible note-keeping tool with a focus on
      rapid entry and retrieval providing enhanced memory augmentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key incite(s):</strong> There are a plethora of note-keeping tools
      available, but none have the primary objective of relieving the burden of
      the limited human working memory in today's high-information world. To be
      effective at this, Secundus Note Keeper will provide the multimodal tools
      and interfaces needed to input new notes/data/todos in an instance, with
      zero friction, while simultaneously providing the smart interfaces
      necessary to effortlessly retrieve stored information at the exact moment
      when it is needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      (I have been using a hacked-together system that functions just as
      described here for two years now, tweaking it over the years. It has
      helped me tremendously and I think it can be easily developed into a solid
      and useful product.)
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 2 - DataDataData<sup>3</sup></h3>

    <p>
      <strong>The product:</strong> A personal data collection and analysis hub
      integrated on top of the Note Keeper platform. While Note Keeper is built
      for quick ingestion and retrieval of low-frequency, low-bandwidth,
      non-structured data, DataDataData is built for automatic ingestion of
      high-frequency, low- or high-bandwidth, structured data coupled with
      automatic machine learning analysis and reporting on the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key incite(s):</strong> The data is already being collected via a
      wide array of devices, the key will be aggregating this data and using
      state of the art ML techniques providing automatic and actionable
      insights.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 3 - Secund.me</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>The product:</strong> A virtual personal assistant that knows
      everything you know.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key incite(s):</strong> Context motherfucker! This is the big one.
      This is what makes current virtual assistants virtually useless - the lack
      of context about you and the current situation. Of the 7 necessary
      requirements for a functionally viable virtual personal assistant outlined
      in the Odenli manifesto, only context remains as the piece the big three
      have yet to even remotely crack. Hence the most common three things we say
      to our personal assistants are "shutup, Siri", "shutup, Alexa", and
      "shutup, Google". Stages 1 and 2 are effectively a trojan horse for
      context collection cleverly disguised as useful products.
    </p>

    <h3>Stage 4 - Secund.life</h3>

    <p><strong>The Product:</strong> An immortal digital copy of yourself.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key incite(s):</strong> This one is really just an evolution of
      Stage 3. ML techniques are already 99% of the way there to replicate an
      exact human voice, photograph, and video. We will have enough data to take
      advantage of these systems. Coupled with the personal data we have on the
      user, these will be remarkably life-like.
    </p>

    <p>
      This one we make free to all users. Stages 1 - 3 should have corresponding
      waves of new user signups that fade over time. Secund.life will act as
      bait to get the rest of the world on the platform, for who doesn't want to
      live forever.<sup>4</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people don't get to know their loved ones as well as they could have
      or wanted to before they go. Secund.life can be a great way to relieve
      some of the pain associated with this phenomenon.
    </p>

    <h2>Addendum</h2>

    <h3>Business Models</h3>

    <p>Subscriptions for Note Keeper/DataDataData features.</p>

    <p>App-store style marketplace for Note Keeper/DataDataData/Secund.me</p>

    <h3>Additional Product Features</h3>

    <p>
      Specific stage product details are not outlined here, but there are a few
      basic existing services that should obviously be included within the
      platform, such as, calendar management, password management, and a payment
      system.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Requirements</h3>

    <p>
      Nothing new has to be invented. There are no major breakthroughs that must
      be had. That said, there must be an absolute focus on privacy and security
      controls, otherwise, the product will be doomed for failure.
    </p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>

    <p>
      It is very possible not enough people try to wrangle as much information
      as I do for even Note Keeper to be a viable product.
    </p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>

    <p>
      *1 - Currently owned: secund.us, secund.me, secund.life. Currently
      parked/for sale: secundus.com, secund.com, second.com, second.us,
      second.me, second.life.
    </p>

    <p>*2 - Current team: me.</p>

    <p>*3 - Working title.</p>

    <p>
      *4 - People who lack imagination, that's who. It is not immediately clear
      what percentage of the population that is. It could be large enough to be
      put into the Risks section.
